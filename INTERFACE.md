# INTERFACE.md — design decisions

Every design and API decision Bland has settled in code, written so a new
component can be built from this file, `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/components.md`
without re-deciding anything. If you are about to invent a value, a pattern, a
prop name or a component, look here first.

**Update this file the moment a decision is made**, not at the end of a task. A
decision is anything a future component would otherwise have to guess at. The
short rule goes in `CLAUDE.md` ("Decisions code must follow"); the detail, the
reason and the date go here.

Companions: `LEARNINGS.md` (bugs and gotchas), `EXECUTIONS.md` (what was done,
when), `docs/components.md` (how to build one).

## 1. Foundations

### Tokens are the only source of values
- Figma owns every value; `npm run tokens` generates `src/tokens/tokens.css`
  from the verified export. 612 variables, 517 CSS tokens (2026-10-17).
- Components read only Theme and scale tokens. Primitives are never emitted.
- No value without a token. When none fits, stop and ask Godwin; the answer is a
  new Figma variable, synced (that is how `duration/spin` came about).

### Light and dark
- Light on `:root`. Dark redefines only the Theme tokens and the elevation
  shadows, under `[data-theme="dark"]`, and under `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
  when no `data-theme="light"` is set. Apps can use either; which one products
  use is still an open question in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Type
- Inter for interface text, Geist Mono for code, self-hosted through
  Fontsource (`bland/fonts.css`): Inter 400, 500, 600 and Geist Mono 400, 600
  only, because those are the weights the text styles use.
- Components set type with the composite: `font: var(--type-body-md)`.

### Corners and focus
- Every rounded element gets `bland-smooth` (`corner-shape: superellipse(2)`).
  The exponent is a first guess, not yet tuned against Figma; tune it once in
  `src/styles/base.css`.
- Every focusable element gets `bland-focus-ring`: `:focus-visible` only, 2px
  `--border-focused`, 2px offset.

### Disabled
- Disabled states use the disabled color tokens. No opacity, ever; the lint
  rejects `opacity` on disabled selectors.

## 2. Component API conventions (decided 2026-10-17)

- **Plain CSS classes, not CSS Modules.** `.bland-<name>`, parts
  `.bland-<name>__<part>`, variants as data attributes (`data-size`,
  `data-type`, `data-emotion`), so projects can override with ordinary
  selectors.
- **Figma property names become camelCase props**, prefixes dropped; variant
  values stay lowercase strings. State (rest, hover, pressed) and `👀 Focused`
  are never props.
- **Defaults:** a component's size defaults to `md` in code even where Figma's
  component default is `xs` (Button: xs is for dense desktop UI only).
- **A Figma property that clashes with a native attribute is renamed on the
  native side:** Button's Figma `Type` is the `type` prop; the native button
  type is `htmlType`, defaulting to `button` so a Button in a form never
  submits by accident.
- **Slots and instance swaps are React nodes**: `children`, `iconStart`,
  `iconEnd`, `icon`, `leading`, `trailing`.
- Remaining native props spread onto the root; `className` is accepted.

## 3. Icons (decided 2026-10-17)

- Bland ships no icon pack. Every icon prop takes any SVG node, so projects can
  use Phosphor at any weight, Lucide or their own.
- `<Icon>` sizes the SVG from `icon/*` and colors it with `currentColor`.
  Stroked icons get `stroke-md` (1.5) at every size with
  `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`; filled icons keep their own weight.
- A component sets its icon size with `--bland-icon-size` on the slot's parent;
  the default lives on `:root` (see LEARNINGS).
- Bland's own icons (`src/icons/`) are exported from the Figma Icons page as
  components need them: Check, X, CaretDown, Plus, Minus, User, Spinner so far.

## 4. Overflow

- Anything that scrolls uses `ScrollArea`: the `.bland-scroll-fade` mask plus an
  overlay thumb (Figma `_scrollbar`) 4px in from the scrolling edge, always
  visible, draggable, outside the mask. The native scrollbar is hidden; wheel,
  touch and keyboard scrolling stay native.
- Fade length `md` (32) by default, `sm` (16) for compact areas such as Menu.
- The thumb's minimum length is `control/xs` (24).

## 5. Motion

Rules in `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/motion.md`. Decisions on top of them:
- **Loading spinners** turn once per `duration/spin` (800ms, added 2026-10-17)
  with `easing/linear`, and stand still under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Press feedback:** `scale(0.97)` on `:active`, `duration/sm`, `easing/out`.

## 6. Components

### Button and Icon Button (2026-10-17, the reference component)
- Props: `size` xs/sm/md/lg (default md), `emotion` brand/success/danger/warning,
  `type` primary/secondary/ghost/stroke, `htmlType`, `iconStart`, `iconEnd`,
  `loading` (`true` = start side, or `'start'` / `'end'`).
- Loading puts the spinner in place of the icon on that side, keeps the label
  and colors, sets `aria-busy`, and ignores clicks until it ends.
- Icon Button requires `aria-label`; loading swaps its icon for the spinner.
- CSS pattern every component copies: emotion and type blocks set private
  custom properties, and one rule per state reads them.

### Avatar (2026-10-18)
- Props: `size` xs–3xl (default md; Figma's default xs is 16px), `type`
  image/placeholder/initials, `src`, `alt`, `initials`, `topSlot`,
  `bottomSlot`, `imgProps`.
- **`type` is optional:** omitted, it is image with a `src`, initials with
  `initials`, else placeholder. A missing or failed image falls back to the
  initials, then the placeholder; the failure is keyed to the `src`, so a new
  `src` tries again. The image's `surface-500` fill shows while it loads.
- **Accessible name is `alt`.** With it, the image (or the initials or
  placeholder circle, as `role="img"`) is named; without it, the avatar is
  decorative, for when the name is printed beside it.
- **Initials:** xs shows the first character (Figma's description); other
  sizes show up to two, so a name like "Ada Lovelace" passed as "AL" fits.
- **Two slots, as in Figma:** `topSlot` for a count, `bottomSlot` for a status
  dot. Both sit outside the clipped circle, centred on its edge at 45 degrees
  (`50% ± 50% × cos(45deg)`), in a box of `avatar/slot-*` that fits the
  matching Indicator size. They accept any node; the Indicator was not on main
  when Avatar shipped.
- **Circles skip `.bland-smooth`:** on a full circle Figma's smoothing has no
  straight edge to act on, and `corner-shape` would make it a squircle.
- Not interactive; wrap it in a button or link when it needs focus.

## 7. The docs site (`npm run docs`, 2026-10-17)

- A sidebar of style pages (generated from `tokens.json`) and components
  (one per story), and a System / Light / Dark switch remembered per browser.
  The selected option is a `stroke` Button, because `secondary` vanishes on
  `surface-200`.
- A component page has: description (the Figma set description), the import
  line, a live demo with controls, the code snippet for the current props,
  Variants (the story's `render`, also the screenshot fixture) and props
  tables generated from the TypeScript and JSDoc.
- Mobile first: below the tablet breakpoint the sidebar becomes a Menu.
- The docs chrome lives in `playground/`, outside the Bland package and the
  lint, but uses Bland's tokens and components wherever one fits.
